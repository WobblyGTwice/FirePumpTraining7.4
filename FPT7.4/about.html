            <p> Fire Apparatus are complex pieces of equipment from the front bumper to the tailboard. They
                incorporate many individual systems working in unison to provide a safe, reliable tool for attacking fire.
                The technicians tasked to ensure this equipment accomplishes the task are asked to be knowledgable in
                many disciplines. The Emergency Vehicle Technician Program is a certification group consiting of master
                EVTs and Industry experts dedicated to advancing technician knowledge through the certification
                process.

                I have recently retired from the Waterous Company having spent the last 30 plus years in the Service and
                Training department. My career was spent developing, instructing and organizing our mechanic seminar
                programs. The program covered the theory, detrimental aspects operation/maintanence/overhaul and 
                testing of Waterous fire pumps and accessories. I also developed and presented F3 (FirePump and
                Accessories) and F7(Foam and CAFS) test preperation classes. I have been involved with the EVT 
                Certification Commission (F3 and F7) since 1999.

                The main focus of Prep Classes is pump, foam, and caf systems oriented. Teaching how pump and Foam
                systems work, detrimental aspects, operation, maintenance, overhaul and testing provides an overall
                working understanding.
